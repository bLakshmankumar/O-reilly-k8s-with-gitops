Organizing Git Repositories for GitOps Environments :
=====================================================
   1) Understanding Single Branch Strategy :
   -----------------------------------------
       In the single branch strategy, one Git repository is used, with a specific directory for each of the environments
       Kubernetes Kustomize is used to adopt the configuration for a specific environment
       Environment-specific settings will be in each of the subdirectories, as different resources are required in production and pre-production.
       The advantage of this strategy is that all code is still in one branch, but Kustomization is required to create the specific environments
       In a GitOps environment, stages are defined for different environments.
       These stages and environments should be presented in the Git repositories.
       Common solutions are the single branch strategy and the multi-branch strategy

   2) Understanding Multi-branch Strategy :
   ----------------------------------------
       In a multi-branch strategy, each branch has the specific configuration that is required in an environment.
       As a disadvantage, there is no common code that is shared through all the environments, which is likely to make multi-branch less efficient

   3) Managing Configuration :
   ---------------------------
       Creating configurations for the different environments is taken care of by Kubernetes
       The core Kubernetes resources to do so are Configmap and Secret
       Kubernetes provides different solutions to manage configurations which will be explored in more depth in Lesson 10:
           > Helm
           > Kustomize
