# What is a Pipeline ?
======================
     a) A pipeline is a set of connected data processing elements
     b) The output of one element is used as input of the next element
     c) Elements of a pipeline can be executed in order or in parallel, depending on the underlying architecture
     d) A software pipeline defines how the output of one command can be used as input of the next command
     e) A CI/CD pipeline moves the software build process through its different stages.
   # Types of Pipelines:
   =====================
     a) Instruction Pipeline:
     ------------------------
        Defines how CPUs handle their instructions and move them forward to the next CPU component.
     b) Software Pipeline:
     ---------------------
        Defines how the output of one command can be used as input for the next command.
     c) CI/CD Pipeline:
     ------------------
        Moves the software build process through its different stages, automating steps from code integration to deployment.

# Creating Pipelines for DevOps :
=================================
     In DevOps, CI/CD is organized in pipelines to streamline and automate the software development and deployment processes.
     The pipeline automates all steps in CI/CD according to the needs of a specific environment.
     At the end of the pipeline, updated software is provided, ready for deployment.
     In a Kubernetes-based environment, the updated software is delivered using images.To make it easy to identify new versions, image tags should always be used.
   Simply : 
   =======
     CI/CD pipelines in DevOps facilitate the automated delivery of software updates, ensuring that the deployment process is efficient and consistent.
     Using image tags in Kubernetes-based environments helps in managing and identifying different software versions easily.

# Common DevOps CI/CD Stages :
==============================
  stage-1 : Pipeline Trigger:
  --------------------------
     The pipeline is triggered automatically when new code is committed.
     Webhooks are commonly used for this purpose.
  stage-2 : Code Checkout:
  -------------------------
     The code is fetched from the source repository.
  stage-3 : Code Compile:
  -----------------------
     The code is compiled to create a running application.
  stage-4 : Run Unit Tests:
  -------------------------
     Unit tests are executed to verify that individual parts of the application work as expected.
  stage-5 : Code Packaging:
  -------------------------
     The compiled code is packaged, typically by building a container image.
  stage-6 : Automated Testing:
  ----------------------------
     Automated tests are run to ensure the application works as expected.
  stage-7 : Delivery:
  -------------------
     The pipeline produces artifacts that are ready to be deployed in production.
  stage-8 : Deployment:
  ---------------------
     The artifacts are deployed, resulting in a running, updated application without any human intervention.
